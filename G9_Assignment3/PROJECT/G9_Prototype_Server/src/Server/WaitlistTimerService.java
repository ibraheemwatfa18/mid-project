/**
 * enforces the 1-hour confirmation window for waiting-list promotions.
 *
 * <p>when {@link DBController#promoteFromWaitingList} promotes a visitor, it creates a HELD
 * (pending) order, marks the waiting_list row {@code NOTIFIED} with a {@code confirmation_deadline}
 * one hour out, and calls {@link #schedulePromotionTimeout(int)} here. two independent mechanisms
 * then guarantee the slot is released if the visitor never confirms:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a precise one-shot timer scheduled exactly 1 hour after the promotion, and</li>
 *   <li>a recurring sweep every {@value #SWEEP_INTERVAL_MINUTES} minutes that catches any
 *       expired entry, including promotions whose one-shot timer was lost to a server restart.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>both paths funnel through {@link DBController#expireWaitlistEntry}, which is idempotent:
 * if the visitor confirmed in the meantime the held order is no longer pending, so nothing is
 * cancelled. on a genuine expiry the held order is cancelled, the visitor is notified (email +
 * server "Simulation" popup), and the freed slot is promoted to the next person in line.
 *
 * <p>singleton; call {@link #start(DBController)} once at server start. the executor thread is a
 * daemon so it never blocks JVM shutdown, and all UI work is marshalled onto the FX thread.
