/**
 * Plain (non-JavaFX) entry point used as the {@code Main-Class} of the runnable
 * server JAR ({@code G9_server.jar}).
 *
 * <p>Why this class exists: when a JAR's {@code Main-Class} is a subclass of
 * {@code javafx.application.Application}, the Java launcher refuses to start with
 * <em>"Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing"</em> unless JavaFX is supplied
 * on the module path. Because {@link ServerUI} extends {@code Application}, we point
 * the JAR manifest at this launcher instead. It is an ordinary class, so the guard is
 * skipped, and it simply hands control to {@link ServerUI#main(String[])}, which starts
 * JavaFX the normal way. This lets the bundled JAR run with a plain {@code java -jar}.
 *
 * @see ServerUI
